	abstract = {Distributed embedded systems have traditionally been designed using static approaches, i.e., assuming a static environment. Such approaches, however, cannot guarantee continuous operation under dynamic environments that impose new requirements upon a system as time passes. As a solution, flexible approaches have been proposed. One such approach that allows a system to adapt to changing real-time requirements is the Flexible Time-Triggered ({FTT}) communication paradigm. Nevertheless, if continuous operation under dynamic environments is desired, then flexibility is not enough. Indeed, it is also crucial for the system to be sufficiently reliable. In this paper we therefore explore some design ideas to make {FTT} highly reliable through fault tolerance by using replication. As a starting point we will use the switch of the Hard Real-Time Ethernet Switching ({HaRTES}) implementation of {FTT}.},

	abstract = {The communication subsystem of distributed embedded systems ({DES}) that must operate continuously and satisfy unpredictable requirement changes must be reliable and flexible. Recently the Flexible Time-Triggered Replicated Star for Ethernet ({FTTRS}) has been proposed as a communication subsystem that satisfies these two attributes. It is based on the master/multi-slave Flexible-Time Triggered ({FTT}) communication paradigm and relies on two custom switches, each with its own embedded {FTT} master. Both masters are active simultaneously and provide the same service. Specifically, they simultaneously and periodically broadcast so-called trigger messages ({TMs}) in a redundant manner to make them robust to transient channel faults. One of the functions of these {TMs} is to divide the communication time into rounds called elementary cycles ({ECs}). For the correct operation of {FTTRS}, it is important that all slaves agree when each {EC} starts and ends. A mechanism to achieve this has been recently proposed. This paper presents a first implementation of this mechanism and a series of experimental tests that constitute a first step towards building a prototype of an {FTTRS} network.},

One of the key parts of such an architecture is the communication subsystem. When designing such a subsystem many decisions have to be made. To understand how such decisions impact the reliability of the final design, in this paper we present a framework to evaluate the reliability of a large number of potential designs. The approach is based on storing a finite subset of the design space for the communication subsystem of {FT}4FTT in an undirected graph and then generating a continuous-time Markov chain from the graph to evaluate the reliability of each design belonging to the subset.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, distributed embedded systems have been designed using static approaches, i.e., assuming a static environment. However, when the environment is dynamic and imposes changing requirements on the system, flexible approaches are needed. If in addition the system must operate continuously, then high reliability is also required. The necessary flexibility for real-time requirements may be provided by Hard Real-Time Ethernet Switching ({HaRTES}), which is an implementation of the master/multi-slave Flexible Time Triggered ({FTT}) communication paradigm. To help provide high reliability, the Flexible Time-Triggered Replicated Star ({FTTRS}) adds network fault tolerance by duplicating the {HaRTES} switch and master, as well as the network links. This paper discusses how to enforce replica determinism for the masters in {FTTRS} by ensuring that they show corresponding outputs both in the time and value domain. Moreover, it suggests how to proceed in case replica determinism is lost despite all efforts.},

Flexibility for changing realtime requirements may be provided by Hard Real-Time Ethernet Switching ({HaRTES}), an implementation of the master/multi-slave Flexible Time Triggered ({FTT}) communication paradigm. {HaRTES} relies on a single switch that embeds the {FTT} master and thus constitutes a single point of failure. Moreover, the trigger messages ({TMs}), which are periodic polling messages sent by the master to the slaves, are critical for the correct operation of any {FTT} implementation. Nevertheless, {HaRTES} has no mechanism to prevent their loss. To provide high reliability through fault tolerance, the Flexible Time-Triggered Replicated Star ({FTTRS}) duplicates the {HaRTES} switch and master, and modifies the masters to proactively retransmit the {TMs}. This spatial and temporal redundancy requires an appropriate management by the slaves. This paper discusses how this management can be performed.},
